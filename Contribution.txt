All contributions and/or suggestions are welcome (Especially in design)

Note to contributors: Only a basic set of features have been implemented. You are welcome to add or suggest
more features, but keep in mind that the goal for this app is:

1) Lightweight: The running cost of this app should be kept to a minimum, stealing as little computation
resources away from the actual Minecraft-server as possible.
2) Accessable and simple: It should be easy to setup and use. The code itself should be as simple as possible
(no unneccessary complexity)
